##  About the Project

This project is a simple web application designed for me and my friends who want to:
- Record their **personal records (PRs)** in **bench press**, **squat**, and **deadlift**
- **Compare their performances with friends** in neat leaderboards (including weight-difference comparisons)

The project is mainly a **learning fullstack project** for practicing and exploring different technologies.
